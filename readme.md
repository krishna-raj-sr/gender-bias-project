## ðŸ§¾ Description

This dataset contains textual materials from academic and official documents produced at the **Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras), Chennai**. The research investigates the **multilayered relationship between language, gender, and workplace** in the academic context of India, focusing on linguistic imbalance and implicit masculine bias.

### Key Findings

- Decline in overt gender bias over time, but residual masculine preference in co-occurrence patterns
- Presence of masculine lexical items (e.g., _chairman_) compared to gender-neutral alternatives
- Higher tendency for neutral terms to collocate with masculine expressions
- Evidence supporting policy shifts towards gender-inclusive institutional language
